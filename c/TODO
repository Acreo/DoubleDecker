long term addons
- add automatic generation of client names   

bugs
- NODST doesn't properly strip tenant. 

   

   



1. Multi-broker notify doesn't strip "tenant." properly
- Fixed in 306b7e3 
2. Multi-broker unsub doesn't work properly (unsub not sent south)
- Almost fixed, need to add a check in cmd_cb_unsub to only send unsubs south/north if
   something was actually removed from trie/hashtable
- FIXED now

 3. Multi-broker sub doesn't work properly (sub not forwarded north)
- Fixed (I think?)     
   4. When a local broker dies, it's clients are not properly delete from dist_cli_ht
- Fixed!

4. When a higher level broker dies and come backs, the lower only sends it's local
   clients, but not any distant ones
- Fixed!, was a race problem with a state betweek REGISTERED and ROOT.

- remove broker names and replace with numberical unique TLV (or LV)
  - Broker names removed!
  realized that they dont have to be actually unique, just unique
  between a top broker and its local broker clients.
  They already have unique names (sockid!) so .. easy peasy
