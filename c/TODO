long term addons
- add automatic generation of client names   
- get rid of the need for adding customer name on command line
   actually only used to determine wheter client is public or not
   the same information can be found in the keyfile

- get rid of NODST and replace with a generic ERROR(code, reason) message

   
bugs
- Return -1 or 0 depending if notify(), subscribe(), etc succedded (i.e.  were registered
- when then call was made)


   
   

   



1. Multi-broker notify doesn't strip "tenant." properly
- Fixed in 306b7e3 
2. Multi-broker unsub doesn't work properly (unsub not sent south)
- Almost fixed, need to add a check in cmd_cb_unsub to only send unsubs south/north if
   something was actually removed from trie/hashtable
- FIXED now

 3. Multi-broker sub doesn't work properly (sub not forwarded north)
- Fixed (I think?)     
   4. When a local broker dies, it's clients are not properly delete from dist_cli_ht
- Fixed!

4. When a higher level broker dies and come backs, the lower only sends it's local
   clients, but not any distant ones
- Fixed!, was a race problem with a state betweek REGISTERED and ROOT.

- remove broker names and replace with numberical unique TLV (or LV)
  - Broker names removed!
  realized that they dont have to be actually unique, just unique
  between a top broker and its local broker clients.
  They already have unique names (sockid!) so .. easy peasy
